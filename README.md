# AI-project"# Sudoku_AI" 
An AI which can solve sudoky with a 100% success rate using back tracking.
In addition to backtracking, I have used stochastic beam search in order to see
how different the results would be, and whether it's possible heuristically find the optimal
solution without exhausting all the possibilities
